**Fitness 4 Free is free.**

**Fitness 4 Free doesn't sell workout or coaching services.**

**Fitness 4 Free allows you to train with the best programs and workouts of the moment.**

### Fitness 4 Free's vision
For years the fitness world has been trapped by poor content, workout programs that do not guarantee a result and incompetent trainers in annual programming. Every year we find advertisements pushing a new training method making the previous one obsolete, trainers boasting results achieved through their training methods and often disguised by photo retouching or the use of substances. **Fitness 4 Free** was born with the idea of making fitness a better place.

### The mission of Fitness 4 Free
**Fitness 4 Free** wants to shape the world of commercial fitness by making it accessible and free of deception by offering workouts that ensure you get results.

#### Who is it addressed to?
Everyone who frequents the fitness world, from beginner to advanced. **Fitness 4 Free** provides workout plans or individual workouts totally free of charge. What differentiates this plan from a regular free workout app? Almost all apps on the market only provide you with a few workouts and if you want to progress you have to subscribe, while **Fitness 4 Free** requires no memberships or subscriptions.
