### How to progress?
The progression of this training sheet is based on progressively increasing the load in almost all exercises. The choice of training load in the fundamental exercises must allow us to do a hypothetical extra repetition (Example: flat bench with barbell I will choose a load that allows me to safely do 13/11/9/7 repetitions), so that we are sure to close all the sets.

### When to change this card?
Once I reach a limit where our technique does not allow us to keep going, the estimated life span of this card is about 3 to 4 months.
